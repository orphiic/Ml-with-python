# Machine Learning with Python
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to learn and make decisions based on data, without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms can be trained on large datasets to recognize patterns, classify data, and make predictions or decisions. There are many different types of machine learning algorithms, including supervised learning algorithms, which learn from labeled training data, and unsupervised learning algorithms, which learn from unlabeled data. Some popular applications of machine learning include image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modeling. Machine learning is an active area of research and development, with new techniques and approaches being developed all the time.

## How To Start?
It is essential to study mathematics as well as statistics so that you can calculate significant numbers based on data sets.
Learn how to use various Python modules to get the answers we need
And how to make functions that are able to predict the outcome based on what we have learned.

## Dataset
A data set is any collection of data in the mind of a computer. It can range from an array to an entire database.

An array example:
```json
[99,86,87,88,111]
```
| Bike          | Color         |age         | speed      |    feature        
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| Honda  | Red  |4  | 99  | y |         
| Yamaha  | Blue  |7 | 86  | n  | 
| Apache  | white  |8 | 77  | n  |
| Beneli  | Black  |2 | 111  | y  |
| Hero | red  |2 | 103  | n  |  

We can predict the average by glancing at the array, and we can also identify the greatest and lowest values, yet what else can we do?
And we can see from the information that the most prevalent color is red and the oldest bike is 8 years old, but what if we could forecast if a bike has a feature only by looking at the other value systems?
That is the purpose of Machine Learning! Analyzing data and forecasting outcomes!
